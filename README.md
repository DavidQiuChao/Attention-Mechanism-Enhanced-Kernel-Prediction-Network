# Attention-Mechanism-Enhanced-Kernel-Prediction-Network
This is an unoffial implement of papaer "ATTENTION MECHANISM ENHANCED KERNEL PREDICTION NETWORKS FOR DENOISING OF BURST IMAGES" in 2019.

The GPU memory cost of this code for training is much higher than the one mentioned by the paper, and I donot figure out why.

## How to train the code
Please replace some key params in the script "param.cfg" and run the command "python main.py -c param.cfg" for training.
